1. In a medium pot of salted boiling water, simmer tofu for 2 minutes. If using frozen tofu, simmer until completely defrosted. Remove from heat and let drain in a colander lined with paper towels. When cool enough to handle, gently squeeze and pat dry. If using frozen tofu, use firmer pressure to squeeze out water.
2. Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces, then toss together with soy sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Once liquids are absorbed, toss tofu with cornstarch.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add tofu and let cook until golden on all sides, turning occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and remove from skillet and set aside.
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in string beans, carrots, broccoli, red pepper, and green onions. Cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, water, brown sugar, and cornstarch. Return tofu to skillet and add sauce mixture to pan. Stir and cook until slightly thickened, 2 minutes.
