1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Cut tofu in half so you have two even, flat pieces. Press the moisture out of the tofu, using paper towels or a towel. Cut tofu into cubes and transfer to a bowl.
3. Add cornstarch, soy sauce, and olive oil to the bowl. Toss gently to coat.
4. Transfer to the baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring once or twice, to get the tofu evenly browned and crispy.
5. Mix Yum Yum sauce and chili crisp in a small bowl.
6. When the tofu is done, toss it with several tablespoons of sauce, reserving sauce for topping.
7. Serve with rice, on a salad, noodles, or anything you like. Dollop with extra sauce if you want, and top with green onions.
